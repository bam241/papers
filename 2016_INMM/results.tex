As a part of the \gls{CVT}\footnote{http://cvt.engin.umich.edu/}, \Cyclus is being used to generate multi-modal datasets with signatures of diversion with the goal of improving anomaly and change detection techniques. Figure \ref{fig:scenario_layout} illustrates a toy scenario in which \gls{HEU} is clandestinely produced and then diverted from a declared enrichment facility. A mine supplies natural uranium (0.7\% $^{235}$U) to an enrichment facility, which in turn receives requests for \gls{LEU} one of five enrichment levels (3-5\%) from several declared light-water reactors (ignoring the fuel fabrication facility for simplicity).  The enrichment facility also receives requests for 90\% enriched \gls{HEU} from an undeclared actor seeking to build a nuclear weapon. Each month, the enrichment facility fulfills an order for one \gls{LEU} enrichment level, and sometimes produces small quantities of \gls{HEU} request.

Figure \ref{fig:time_series} shows the time series data for declared production of \gls{LEU} (top) and the total \gls{SWU} consumed by the enrichment plant (middle) available to the inspector (\gls{SWU} can be used as a rough proxy for power consumption).  Months where \gls{HEU} is produced are denoted with green on the \gls{LEU} plot.  The \gls{HEU} signature is hidden in the material flow because there is a gaussian variation in both the tails assay and the quantity of LEU produced, so it is not possible to detect diversion from the individual time-series data alone. However, the two signals can be combined to highlight the correlated signature of diverion. The bottom plot in Figure \ref{fig:time_series} shows time-series data for the ratio of SWU consumption to declared \gls{LEU} production.  When the variation due to changes in tails assay is sufficiently small, the deviations may be seen by eye. In practice, as the variations increase or the \gls{HEU} quantity reduces in amplitude, this signature requires sophisticated change detection techniques to catch.

While this example is clearly a toy model, it illustrates the power of combining multiple signals from a scenario to improve detection capabilities.\Cyclus is being used provide more complex synthetic datasets to groups that specialize in developing advanced anomaly detection techniques. An ongoing collaboration with researchers at the Michigan Institute for Data Science\footnote{http://midas.umich.edu/} seeks to apply innovative anomaly and change detection techniques to these simulations to investigate detection limits for scenarios with sparse data sets or low signal-to-noise ratios.

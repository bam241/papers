Each student will be required to complete a term paper with an oral presentation. Along the way students will work in teams on class presentations on journal articles or other issues. The term paper will be the major determinant of the course grade. Attendance in class and active participation is required. This is a graduate seminar with reading and discussion as the main activity, not listening to lectures. The calendar below is very approximate. We will choose among the readings as we go along, so you should regard the syllabus as a resource. I invite you to read as much as you want.},

	abstract = {As a nation develops its nuclear strategies, it must consider various aspects of nuclear energy such as sustainability, environmental-friendliness, proliferation-resistance, economics, technologies, and so on. A nuclear fuel cycle study could give convincing answers to many questions in regard to technical aspects. However, one nuclear fuel cycle option cannot be superior in all aspects. Therefore a nation must identify its top priority and accordingly evaluate all the possible nuclear fuel cycle options. For such a purpose, this paper examined four different fuel cycle options that are likely to be plausible under situation of Republic of Korea: once-through cycle, DUPIC recycling, thermal recycling using MOX fuel in PWR (pressurized water reactor), and SFR (sodium cooled fast reactor) employing fuel recycling by a pyroprocess. The options have been quantitatively compared in terms of resource utilization and waste generation based on 1 TWh electricity production at a “steady-state” condition as a basic analysis. This investigation covered from the front-end of the fuel cycles to the final disposal and showed that the Pyro-SFR recycling appears to be the most competitive from these material quantitative aspects due to the reduction of the required uranium resources and the least amount of waste generation.},

This will result in the ability to choose technologies based, at least in part, on their effectiveness to deter the proliferation of nuclear materials and technology. The assessment methodology generates a relative proliferation resistance measure as a function of time for the history of a unit mass input into the fuel cycle. A variety of attributes are used in the generation of this proliferation resistance measure. This methodology was applied to a variety of simple single process systems and several multi-process, long-term systems to demonstrate its viability as an assessment methodology and its capability in discriminating diverse fuel cycle options.},

	abstract = {Key components of a novel methodology and implementation of an agent-based, dynamic nuclear fuel
cycle simulator,
Cyclus
, are presented. The nuclear fuel cycle is a complex, physics-dependent supply
chain. To date, existing dynamic simulators have not treated constrained fuel supply, time-dependent,
isotopic-quality based demand, or fuel fungibility particularly well. Utilizing an agent-based methodology
that incorporates sophisticated graph theory and operations research techniques can overcome these
deficiencies. This work describes a simulation kernel and agents that interact with it, highlighting the
Dynamic Resource Exchange (DRE), the supply-demand framework at the heart of the kernel. The key
agent-DRE interaction mechanisms are described, which enable complex entity interaction through the
use of physics and socio-economic models. The translation of an exchange instance to a variant of the
Multicommodity Transportation Problem, which can be solved feasibly or optimally, follows. An extensive
investigation of solution performance and fidelity is then presented. Finally, recommendations for future
users of
Cyclus
and the DRE are provided.},

	abstract = {A global economy and increase in customer expectations in terms of cost and services have put a premium on effective supply chain reengineering. It is essential to perform risk-benefit analysis of reengineering alternatives before making a final decision. Simulation provides an effective pragmatic approach to detailed analysis and evaluation of supply chain design and management alternatives. However, the utility of this methodology is hampered by the time and effort required to develop models with sufficient fidelity to the actual supply chain of interest. In this paper, we describe a supply chain modeling framework designed to overcome this difficulty. Using our approach, supply chain models are composed from software components that represent types of supply chain agents (e.g., retailers, manufacturers, transporters), their constituent control elements (e.g., inventory policy), and their interaction protocols (e.g., message types). The underlying library of supply chain modeling components has been derived from analysis of several different supply chains. It provides a reusable base of domain-specific primitives that enables rapid development of customized decision support tools.},

We find that the spatial pattern of the weekday– weekend variations of the NO2 column in the model is sig- nificantly different than observed. A sensitivity study shows that the contrasting spatial pattern of NO2 on weekdays and weekends is a useful diagnostic of emissions and chemistry. These improvements suggest that constraints from space- based observations of the processes affecting urban photo- chemistry (e.g., spatial patterns of emissions, ratios of VOC to NOx emissions, rate constants) are possible at a level of detail not previously described.},

A LLD of at least 3.4s 1⁄4 0.14 Bq/m3 with a theo- retical false-positive rate of 0.05\% is recommended for safeguards’ purposes. At this threshold, the continuous separation of 100, 300, and 900 g equivalent weapon-grade plutonium per day was found to correspond to 10\%, 50\%, and 80\% probability of detection, respectively. The smallest detected concentration was for the continuous separation of 45 g/day, with a probability of detection of about 0.6\%. It was found that the detection rate is determined predominately by the weather.},

systems as a dynamic quantity is described in this paper. This method is based upon the direct coupling
of a code for nuclear fuel isotopic characterization (ORIGEN-S) to a model for proliferation resistance,
based upon a generalized fuel cycle model. The resulting coupled model is applied to evaluate PR as
a dynamic system property as a function of three fuel cycle categories: open cycles, a “modified open
cycle” (MOC) consisting of limited actinide recycle, and a fully closed cycle. Proliferation resistance is
evaluated along several key operational parameters of the chosen fuel cycles, including fuel burnup
and actinide separation strategies (including uranium and minor actinide co-extraction). For purposes of
demonstration, a PR model developed at NC State shall be used for fuel cycle PR evaluation; the mechanics
of this model will be presented in brief.},

But empirical evidence gives much reason to doubt these assumptions; people exhibit bounded rationality, bounded self-interest, and bounded willpower. This article offers a broad vision of how law and econom- ics analysis may be improved by increased attention to insights about actual human behavior. It considers specific topics in the economic analysis of law and proposes new models and approaches for addressing these topics. The analysis of the article is organized into three categories: positive, prescriptive, and normative. Positive analysis of law concerns how agents behave in re- sponse to legal rules and how legal rules are shaped. Prescriptive analysis concerns what rules should be adopted to advance specified ends. Normative analysis attempts to assess more broadly the ends of the legal system: Should the system always respect people’s choices? By drawing attention to cognitive and motivational problems of both citizens and government, behavioral law and economics offers answers distinct from those offered by the standard analysis.},

	abstract = {While many potential fuel cycles have been evaluated for their equilibrium properties, there has been less investigation into the properties of transitions from the current once-through light water reactor (LWR) fuel cycle to other candidate fuel cycles.  This work describes a transition analysis performed using black-box optimization techniques coupled with the Cyclus fuel cycle simulator on large scale computing resources.  A transition deployment schedule for thermal and fast reactors was computed by wrapping Cyclus simulations inside an external optimizer.  The resulting deployments provide an approximate optimal solution for the fastest way to transition to an EG23-like fuel cycle without forced early retirement of reactors (for the utilized objective function). Although only reactor deployments are looked at here, the optimization workflow developed is flexible enough to handle deployment of an arbitrary number of facility types. The optimization runs were performed on the HT Condor high throughput computing infrastructure at University of Wisconsin-Madison.  Optimization tools were developed that are robust against failures and instability in the cluster environment.  The optimizer used is a hybrid of particle swarm and modified pattern search algorithms based on PSwarm. It is robust against failed simulations and objective function evaluations and is easy to parallelize.},

	abstract = {The worldwide expansion of nuclear energy has been accompanied by concerns about nuclear weapons proliferation. If sited in states that do not possess nuclear weapons technology, some civilian nuclear technologies could provide a route for states or other organizations to acquire nuclear weapons. Metrics for assessing the resistance of a nuclear technology to diversion for non-peaceful uses-proliferation resistance-have been developed, but at present there is no clear consensus on whether and how these metrics are useful to policy decision makers. In 2011, the U.S. Department of Energy asked the National Academies to convene a public workshop addressing the capability of current and potential methodologies for assessing host state proliferation risk and resistance to meet the needs of decision makers. Proliferation Risk in Nuclear Fuel Cycles is a summary of presentations and discussions that transpired at the workshop-held on August 1-2, 2011-prepared by a designated rapporteur following the workshop. It does not provide findings and recommendations or represent a consensus reached by the symposium participants or the workshop planning committee. However, several themes emerged through the workshop: nonproliferation and new technologies, separate policy and technical cultures, value of proliferation resistance analysis, usefulness of social science approaches. The workshop was organized as part of a larger project undertaken by the NRC, the next phase of which (following the workshop) will be a consensus study on improving the assessment of proliferation risks associated with nuclear fuel cycles. This study will culminate in a report prepared by a committee of experts with expertise in risk assessment and communication, proliferation metrics and research, nuclear fuel cycle facility design and engineering, international nuclear nonproliferation and national security policy, and nuclear weapons design. This report is planned for completion in the spring of 2013.},

This study compares the reactor and fuel cycle costs of the closed system associated with sodium-cooled fast reactors and pyroprocessing versus the once-through system. We specifically investigated the fuel cycle transition cases of the Republic of Korea from 2013 to 2100. The results revealed that the closed system (34.00 mills/kWh as a mean value) could be more expensive than the once-through system (32.75 mills/kWh). In contrast, the once-through fuel cycle costs (8.31 mills/kWh), excluding reactor costs, were projected to be greater than the closed fuel cycle costs (7.77 mills/kWh) because of the increased costs of interim storage estimated by the Korean government and the limited contribution of backend fuel cycle components to the discounted costs. The capital cost of sodium-cooled fast reactor is the largest component contributing to the cost gap between the two systems. Among fuel cycle components, pyroprocessing has the largest uncertainty contribution to the cost gap. We also calculated the breakeven unit costs of SFR capital cost and PWR spent fuel pyroprocessing cost.},

	abstract = {This Preliminary Assessment report presents the results of a literature search and preliminary assessment of the body of research, analysis methods, models, and data deemed to be relevant to the Utility of Social Modeling for Proliferation Assessment research. This report provides: 1) a description of the problem space and the kinds of information pertinent to the problem space, 2) a discussion of key relevant or representative literature, 3) a discussion of models and modeling opportunities judged to have promise to the research, and 4) the next steps of this research that will be pursued based on this preliminary assessment. This report represents a technical deliverable for the NA-22 Simulations, Algorithms, and Modeling program. Specifically this report is the Task 1 deliverable for project PL09- UtilSocial-PD06, Utility of Social Modeling for Proliferation Assessment.
This project investigates the use of social and cultural information to improve nuclear proliferation assessment, including nonproliferation assessment, proliferation resistance assessments, safeguards assessments, and other related studies. These assessments often use and create technical information about the State‘s posture towards proliferation, the vulnerability of a nuclear energy system to an undesired event, and the effectiveness of safeguards. This project will find and fuse social and technical information by explicitly considering the role of cultural, social, and behavioral factors relevant to proliferation. The aim of this research is to describe and demonstrate if and how social science modeling has utility in proliferation assessment.
The primary aim of this report is to summarize the references that have been collected for this research and present our initial assessment of their implications for proliferation assessment. For the sake of providing an organized overview of the body of literature relating to this research, the review was divided into five topics: 1) Theories of State-level proliferation, 2) Proliferation resistance assessment (of technologies), 3) Safeguards analysis, 4) Non-State proliferation and 5) Social and cultural modeling. Abstracts are provided for the key references used in the discussions of each topic.
Based on the literature search we have concluded that there are opportunities to use social models to improve understanding and assessment of proliferation-related problems. In fact, for decades analysts have theorized about the factors that dictate whether a State pursues the development of nuclear weapons–these factors are primarily social factors or are factors that are intimately related to social factors (e.g., national identity, leadership, politics, domestic security, economic capability). Social modeling offers a way to formalize or leverage this body of analysis and theory. This report identifies opportunities for social modeling specifically related to overarching kinds of assessments. These include proliferation resistance assessment of a nuclear energy system, or the assessment of a set of safeguards.
In addition to overarching assessments, there seems to be an untapped potential to augment, support, inform, or complement assessments having a specific modeling or research focus, such as social modeling to support the use of satellite imagery to identify proliferation activity, specific technologies for detection of clandestine facilities, or computerization of a safeguards analysis decision process. In the area of geospatial modeling more explicit use of social modeling might be used to help identify activities or social patterns that correlate to proliferation activity.
A goal of this research is to investigate modeling proliferation using inference models−evidence mathematics. Proliferation theories could be incorporated into a Bayesian network. We present a simplified example model in this report. The model attempts to capture some salient factors relevant to a
state‘s decision to proliferate; such as, technical capability and the regional political situation. Preliminary results in using the model to compare a state that is not a recognized proliferation threat and a state that is are promising. Our intention is to expand this state proliferation model in more detail and potentially add factors relevant to non-State proliferation.
Various approaches and methodologies have been proposed to assess the proliferation resistance of nuclear energy system facilities. An international approach being developed and supported by the Generation IV International Forum Physical Security and Proliferation Resistance working group uses defined proliferation measures and incorporates structured expert elicitation. This methodology uses pathway analysis to evaluate different scenarios in nuclear energy system facilities that could result in nuclear proliferation by considering five potential host-State proliferation strategies: concealed diversion, overt diversion, concealed facility misuse, overt facility misuse, and independent clandestine facility use.
Before pathways can be defined for analysis, the facility‘s Material Balance Areas and Key Measurement Points are identified, along with the safeguards and physical protection measures and nuclear material targets. Pathways are specific scenarios that can be described by a proliferation strategy and target and is divided into three major stages: materials acquisition, material processing, and weaponization. The Generation IV International Forum evaluates each pathway using six measures, the first four of which are intrinsic features of the system, and the last two of which are both intrinsic and extrinsic features. The measures are: 1) technical difficulty, 2) proliferation cost, 3) proliferation time, 4) fissile material type, 5) detection probability, and 6) detection resource efficiency.
Despite the primarily technical nature of this approach, the six proliferation resistance measures have social aspects to them. Proliferation theories can be used to identify behavioral, social, and cultural factors that explain the motivation of a country or organization to develop nuclear weapons. Consideration of the behavioral, social, and cultural factors can be more explicitly integrated into consideration of the proliferation measures against proliferation pathways. In this way social factors could be used to inform nuclear energy system design (i.e., intrinsic characteristics) and safeguards (i.e., extrinsic characteristics) improvement. Bayesian networks and other analytical methods could be used to integrate the social and technical models.
Yet another opportunity for social modeling is the area of non-State proliferation, particularly as it relates to what some analysts call the ―supply-side.‖ The supply-side substructure of nuclear proliferation might be considered to include manufactures, scientists, middlemen, transporters, opportunists, and violent groups who contribute to proliferation by supplying technology, knowledge, and material to the world. The interconnection of these groups is of interest because globalization has produced a large number of organizations that operate across State borders. Analysis of social networks that show the connections, characteristics, and goals of the groups in this substructure may yield interesting clues about proliferation and the role of non-State actors. Consideration of State and non-State proliferation together may lend to novel approaches to proliferation modeling and additional insights.
Opportunities exist for social modeling in proliferation assessment. The challenge of this research is to identify opportunities where social modeling can have a significant impact and demonstrate its utility. Our approach will be to select a social modeling opportunity related to an overarching type of assessment that has promise to be used in other or in more specific kinds of applications. We intend to leverage research at PNNL by using Bayesian networks to model applicable social science or theory. Validation of
these models will be an important step to demonstrating utility and will be built in parallel, based on the modeling application developed.},

	abstract = {The comparison of nuclear facilities based on their barriers to nuclear material proliferation has remained a difficult endeavor, often requiring expert elicitation for each system under consideration. However, objectively comparing systems using a set of computable metrics to derive a single number representing a system is not, in essence, a nuclear nonproliferation specific problem and significant research has been performed for business models. For instance, Multi-Attribute Utility Analysis (MAUA) methods have been used previously to provide an objective insight of the barriers to proliferation. In this paper, the Proliferation Resistance Analysis and Evaluation Tool for Observed Risk (PRAETOR), a multi-tiered analysis tool based on the multiplicative MAUA method, is presented. It folds sixty three mostly independent metrics over three levels of detail to give an ultimate metric for nonproliferation performance comparison. In order to reduce analysts’ bias, the weighting between the various metrics was obtained by surveying a total of thirty three nonproliferation specialists and nonspecialists from
iii
fields such as particle physics, international policy, and industrial engineering. The PRAETOR was used to evaluate the Fast Breeder Reactor Fuel Cycle (FBRFC). The results obtained using these weights are compared against a uniform weight approach. Results are presented for five nuclear material diversion scenarios: four examples include a diversion attempt on various components of a PUREX fast reactor cycle and one scenario involves theft from a PUREX facility in a LWR cycle. The FBRFC was evaluated with uranium-plutonium fuel and a second time using thorium-uranium fuel. These diversion scenarios were tested with both uniform and expert weights, with and without safeguards in place. The numerical results corroborate nonproliferation truths and provide insight regarding fast reactor facilities' proliferation resistance in relation to known standards.},

	abstract = {Over the past 10 years, the ARIES team has been devoting a serious effort to reduce the volume of radwaste generated by fusion power plants.  Recently, an initiative was launched in the U.S. and Europe to reduce the radwaste volume further by clearing the outer components from reuglatory control.  Vefore proceeding further with the development of a new strategy for the U.S. fusion waste management, it is essential to assess the implication of the clearance option on the waste generated by the U.S. advanced power plants.  In this paper, we discuss the results of the analysis, the approach adopted by the ARIES team for handling the cleared components, and the U.S. market for cleared metals.  Our results state that, because of the compactness of the design, none of the ARIES-AT fusion power core components has a clearance index below one at the end of the 100 year interim storage period and all components should be either recycled or disposed near surface as low-level waste.  At present, the U.S. industry has zero tolerance for metals with very low radiation level, meaning the commercial market for cleared metals does not exist.},

	abstract = {A review of existing analysis codes for nuclear fuel cycle systems was performed to determine if any existing codes meet technical and functional requirements de fined for a U.S. national program supporting the global and domestic assessment, development, and deployment of nuclear energy systems. The program would be imple mented using an interconnected architecture of d codes ranging from the fuel cycle analysis code, which is the subject of the review, to fundamental physical and mechanistic codes. Four main functions are defined for the code. Function 1 is the ability to characterize and deploy individual fuel cycle facilities and reactors in a simulation while discretely tracking material move ments. Function 2 is the capability to perform an uncer tainty analysis for each element of the fuel cycle and an aggregate uncertainty analysis. Function 3 is the inclu sion of an optimization engine able to optimize simulta neously across multiple objective functions. Function 4 is open and accessible code software and documentation to aid in collaboration between multiple entities and to facilitate software updates. Existing codes, categorized as annualized or dis crete fuel tracking codes, were assessed according to the fourfunctions and associated requirements. These codes were developed by various government, education, and industrial entities to fulfill particular needs. In some cases, decisions were made during code development to limit the level of detail included in a code to ease its use or to focus on certain aspects of a fuel cycle to address specific questions. The review revealed that while no two of the codes are identical, they all perform many of the same basic functions. No code was able to perform defined function 2 or several requirements of functions 1 and 3. Based on this review, it was concluded that the functions and requirements will be met only with development of a new code, referred to as GENIUS.},

	url = {http://www.bnl.gov/isd/documents/32757.pdf},
	abstract = {Current safeguards approaches used by the IAEA at gas centrifuge enrichment plants (GCEPs) need enhancement in order to detect undeclared LEU production with adequate detection probability. "Mailbox" declarations have been used in the last two decades to verify receipts, production, and shipments at some bulk-handling facilities (e.g., fuel-fabrication plants). The operator declares the status of his plant to the IAEA on a daily basis using a secure "Mailbox" system such as a secure tamper-resistant computer. The operator agrees to hold receipts and shipments for a specified period of time, along with a specified number of annual inspections, to enable inspector access to a statistically large enough population of UF6 cylinders and fuel assemblies to achieve the desired detection probability. The inspectors can access the "Mailbox" during randomly timed inspections and then verify the operator's declarations for that day. Previously, this type of inspection regime was considered mainly for verifying the material balance at fuel-fabrication, enrichment, and conversion plants. Brookhaven National Laboratory has expanded the "Mailbox" concept with short-notice random inspections (SNRIs), coupled with enhanced video surveillance, to include declaration and verification of UF6 cylinder operational data to detect activities associated with undeclared LEU production at GCEPs. Since the "Mailbox" declarations would also include data relevant to material-balance verification, these randomized inspections would replace the scheduled monthly interim inspections for material-balance purposes; in addition, the inspectors could simultaneously perform the required number of Limited-Frequency Unannounced Access (LFUA) inspections used for HEU detection. This approach would provide improved detection capabilities for a wider range of diversion activities with not much more inspection effort than at present.},

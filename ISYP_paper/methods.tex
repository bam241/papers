\section{The \Cyclus Fuel Cycle Simulator}
\label{s_methods}

The \gls{CNERG}\footnote{http://cnerg.github.io/} group at the University of Wisconsin has developed the \Cyclus\footnote{http://fuelcycle.org/} nuclear fuel cycle simulator to model all aspects of the nuclear fuel cycle in a flexible way\cite{cyclus_v1_0,cyclus_v1_2,cyclus_v1_3}.  \Cyclus tracks nuclear material as it flows through the entire fuel cycle in tracked time-steps. It has been designed to compare different types of technologies in the transition from current one-through cycles to alternative next-generation scenarios including potential technologies such as spent fuel recycling. \Cyclus has three key features that make it suitable for non-proliferation studies: it is \emph{agent-based}, it incorporates \emph{social and behavioral interaction models}, and it tracks \emph{discrete materials}.

\subsection{Agent-Based}
\Cyclus is designed using an agent-based framework, meaning that each actor in a fuel cycle (such as a mine, a nuclear reactor, or other) is modeled as an independent agent\cite{jennings2000agent, taylor2014agent}. Each agent is self-contained and may include physics, economics, or behavioral components\cite{huff_transactions_2011,gidden_global_2013,gidden_thesis_2015}.  The agents interact with other agents in the fuel cycle through the \gls{DRE}, which facilitates the trading of resources and commodities\cite{gidden_physor_2014}.  At each time step, agents can choose to request resources.  Resources are defined using both a quantity (1 metric ton), and a quality, such as having a compositions of 99.7\% $^{238}U$ and 0.3\% $^{235}U$.  The \gls{DRE} then solicits bids from any facilities that are interested in offering those resources. Resources can be offered as bids even if they do not exactly match the requested material. For example, a reactor might request a commodity called ``fuel'', which it has defined as being \gls{UOX}.  It may receive bids for ``fuel'' that are specified as \gls{UOX} or \gls{MOX}, having two distinct isotopic compositions. Therefore, after the bids are received, the requestor is able to apply a preference for one bid over another. Finally, once the preferences hve been applied, the \gls{DRE} calculates all potential trades across all agents, then executes a minimization to find the solution that does the best job of fulfilling all the requests.  Once this solution is found, material is transferred across the facilities and the timestep is concluded.

\subsection{Behavioral Modeling}
The preference adjustment phase of the \gls{DRE} allows for the introduction of interaction behaviors.  Each agent can prioritize bids for resources in any way it chooses. A specific agent might have preferences based on material composition, physical proximity between facilities, or allowed and disallowed trading partners. In particular, \Cyclus has a region-insititution-facility hierarchy that facilitiates economic modeling\cite{oliver_thesis_2009}.  Individual facilities can be managed by insistutions, such as multinational corporations, utilities, government agencies, etc.  Additionally, facilities and institutions can be ascribed to unique regions, which may represent geo-political entities or economic trading partners. These features allow \Cyclus to model tariffs, sanctions and other types of economic agreements.  It is possible that as a result of the preference adjustments, no trades are executed for some facilities in a given time step.  Agents may also make decisions about interacting at each timestep based on their own internal logic, for example, an illicit facility may not choose to trade at every timestep in an attempt to avoid detection. 

\subsection{Discrete Materials}
\Cyclus also tracks discrete material flow through the simulation, which means that once a material enters the simulation, its location and quality is tracked at all remaining timepoints\cite{huff_thesis_?}.  \Cyclus includes nuclear data from \emph{Pyne},\footnote{http://pyne.io/} a computational nuclear science tool that enables calculation of decay, transmutation, diffusion and other nuclear physics\cite{scopatz_pyne_2012}. As a result, \Cyclus can  model decay of materials and track all decay products from a parent isotope, facilitating studies of heat loading, radiation exposure, and other derived fuel cycle metrics\cite{scopatz_cymetric_2015}.

Because of the modular design of \Cyclus, individual agents can be swapped in otherwise identical fuel cycles for comparison. For example, a user could compare enrichment technologies by creating two different enrichment agents, one using gaseous diffusion and the other using centrifuge technology. Then two simulations can be run where the entire fuel cycle is identical except for the two different enrichment designs, and the results can therefore be directly compared.

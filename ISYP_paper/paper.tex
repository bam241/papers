\begin{abstract}

  Already the dominant source of clean energy, nuclear power is growing at a
  rapid pace.  While beneficial to a world confronting climate change, the
  nuclear security and non-proliferation impacts of expanding nuclear power
  will become more consequential.  As a result, it is imperative to develop
  credible methods to verify compliance with treaties that control fissile
  material production, such as the Non-Proliferation Treaty or a potential
  Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty. As part of the Consortium for Verification
  Technology, the Cyclus fuel cycle simulator is being used to model current
  and next-generation nuclear fuel cycles to inform treaty verification.  Cyclus
  is an agent-based, systems-level simulator that tracks discrete material flow
  through the entire fuel cycle, from mining through burnup in reactors to a
  repository, or alternatively through one or more iterations of reprocessing.
  Cyclus includes social-behavior models of individual actors, facilitating the
  study of clandestine material diversion from declared fuel cycles.  Cyclus
  also features a region/institution/facility hierarchy that can incorporate the
  effects of tariffs and sanctions in regional or global contexts.  This paper
  presents initial Cyclus simulations of highly enriched uranium diversion from
  a declared once-through fuel cycle.  Material flow signals are analyzed using
  anomaly detection techniques to identify diversion.

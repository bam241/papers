	abstract = {Mining activities generate several impacts. Besides the environmental damages, the exploration of radioactive minerals, such as uranium and thorium, is responsible for another kind of problems and concerns. Radioactive materials can remain dangerous for long time periods, what requires radioprotection measures in order to protect the health of the workers and the public in general. This work shows the results of a radiometric survey done in a uranium mine that is under a decommissioning process, in the southeast region of Brazil. The results show that there is potassium and radium in almost the whole region called Waste Rock Pile number 4, where tons of wastes are deposited. However, the radiation values are under the permissible limits for workers, although the place can not be considered as a free area, according to the Brazilian rules.},
